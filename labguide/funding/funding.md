# Trainee Funding

## How are postdocs in the lab funded?

- Most postdocs in the lab are
    funded through postdoctoral fellowships or grants that they write
    themselves.  
- Some postdocs are funded
    through existing grants. In this case, the postdoc must spend a significant portion of
    their time working on that project. However, the lab also provides
    postdocs the room to develop their own ideas.
- We have the opportunity to
    request [Diversity
    Supplements](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-20-222.html)
    for our NIH grants. If you qualify for such a fellowship (which
    includes individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups,
    disadvantaged backgrounds, or rural/low-income areas), please
    contact Dr. Poldrack to discuss your interest.

Postdocs should pay close attention to the details of their funding arrangement. For example, F32 NIH funding to the university comes with a financial account where the institutional allowance is included. Stanford taps this allowance for 'university insurance', so one should be aware that funds will deplete faster than may be presumed.
