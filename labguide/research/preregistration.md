# Pre-registration and Registered Reports

## Pre-registration

Pre-registration is a mechanism in which one places a detailed description of a planned study into a repository where it is timestamped and will remain immutable.  
For more background information, see [here](https://help.osf.io/article/145-preregistration).

- All empirical projects will be
pre-registered, preferably using the Open Science Framework.

   - Pilot studies need not be
    pre-registered, but should then be subject to a pre-registered
    replication or extension.

- Pre-registration should include
as much detail as possible.  Pre-registration must include at
minimum:

   - Sample size (with justification)

   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria

   - Criteria and procedures for
outlier exclusion and data transformation

   - Primary hypotheses or outcomes to
be tested (or an explicit statement that the study is simply
exploratory)

-  In cases where you can’t say exactly
    how you will do something (usually because the choices are data-dependent), outline your procedures for determining how to
    do the thing, and in particular what aspects of the data will go into making that decision.  
- In some cases, multi-stage
pre-registration may be appropriate

   - E.g. when an initial
    discovery sample is used to determine hypotheses for subsequent
    testing in a validation sample
   - In this case, the initial
    pre-registration should lay out the sampling plan and procedures for
    data splitting, as well as the plan for followup pre-registrations.

- For fMRI studies,
pre-registration should specify:

   - Any anatomical regions of
    interest to be used (with a specific definition and/or image mask
    for the region)
   - Motion modeling strategies
    (including trial- or subject-level exclusion criteria)
   - Confound modeling strategies
    at the trial-, subject- and group-level (including the specific
    design of response time modeling strategies)

- Deviations from pre-registration

   - Pre-registration should not
    be viewed as handcuffs. If a detail of the pre-registration is clearly suboptimal,
    then the rationale for using a more appropriate method should be
    noted, and the optimal method should be used.
   - Publications should include
    an explicit “Deviations from pre-registration” section that outlines
    any deviations and their rationale.

### Registered Reports

Whenever possible, we support the submission of Registered Reports.

Registered reports are a publication mechanism in which one submits a manuscript that contains an Introduction and Methods section that describe a study prior to execution of the research; it is essential a written version of a pre-registration.  
The manuscript is reviewed on the strength of the rationale and methods, and if deemed sufficient it is given an "in-principle acceptance" such that the journal guarantees to publish the paper regardless of the results, as long as the approved methods were followed.

There are currently [over 300 journals](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports#tabid2) that accept Registered Report submissions.  
In addition, Registered Reports can be submitted to [PCI-RR](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/), which is a community project that reviews preprint Registered Reports.
